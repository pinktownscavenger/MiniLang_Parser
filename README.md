# MiniLang Parser

This Python script provides a parser for mathematical expressions. It tokenizes input expressions and constructs parse trees to represent their syntactic structure. The parser supports various operators, variables, and parentheses.

## Features

- Tokenization of mathematical expressions
- Parsing of expressions into parse trees
- Support for operators (+, -, *, /), variables, and parentheses

## Usage

To use the parser, open and execute the `parser.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This notebook contains the code for the parser along with explanations and examples of usage. Run each cell in the notebook to see the parser in action with the provided test expressions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
